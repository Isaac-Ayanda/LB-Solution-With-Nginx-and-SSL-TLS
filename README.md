# Loadbalancer Solution With Nginx and SSL/TLS

In this project, I configured Nginx as a loadbalancer for webservers that are connected to a Database server and NFS server (which is also connected to a Jenkins Server that is linked to Github repo) Additionally, I registered a new domain name as well as configured a secured connection using SSL/TLS certificate.
